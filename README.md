## ✨ Introduction
**Broader Scenario and Dimension Coverage**
We propose DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight unified multimodal model with only 5B parameters (3B VLM + 2B DiT). It integrates five core capabilities: general image generation, general image editing, reasoning image generation, reasoning image editing, and text rendering—within a single model. Across multiple authoritative benchmarks, DeepGen 1.0 is competitive with or surpassing the state-of-the-art unified multimodal models that are 3× to 16× larger, achieving comprehensive performance, demonstrating that massive scaling is not the sole path to high-performance multimodal generation.

## 🧠 Method
Our core observation is that a lightweight model, when empowered by synergistic architecture design and data-centric training strategies, can achieve comprehensive capabilities competitive with or even surpassing much larger counterparts.
To overcome the limitations of lightweight models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce **Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB)**, a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable "think tokens" to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. 
We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) **Alignment Pre-training** on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) **Joint Supervised Fine-tuning** on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) **Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO**, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts.
